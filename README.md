Given n segments, provide a minimal set of points such that each segment contains at least one of these points. 
The first input line contains 1 &le; n &le; 100 segments.
Each successive line (n lines total) contains two numbers  0 &le; l &le; r &le; 10^9 -- segment's endpoints.
The task is to output the optimal amount of m points and these m points themselves. 
If there are several such points sets, output any of those.
